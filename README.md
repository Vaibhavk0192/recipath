# Recipath

Recipath is an AI-based recipe generation website that helps users generate recipes based on recipe keywords. With Recipath, users can subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated on new recipes and features.

To generate a recipe, the user can enter a recipe keyword which may include some starting ingredients or title, and Recipath's AI algorithm will suggest relevant recipes based on the input.

Note: Please note that the recipes generated by Recipath are for fun and educational purposes only, and may not be edible or result in desirable outcomes at times. We recommend users to exercise caution and judgement when attempting to create recipes based on the suggestions provided by Recipath.

## MOTIVATION

Recipath aims to provide users with an optimal solution to find new, delicious, healthy, and presentable cuisines using the available set of ingredients. In the current pandemic period (Covid-19), it may not be easy to get new dishes from outside, and Recipath offers a platform to explore and prepare several new dishes with the available ingredients. The system takes ingredients as input and generates the best-matched recipe from an exhaustive list of most matching recipes.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the speed of recipe generation is limited by the current technological capacity of the development team, who are still students learning and improving their skills.

## Tech Stack

Recipath employs various technologies to provide its users with a seamless and efficient recipe generation service. The following technologies are used in the development of Recipath:

- React.js for the frontend
- Node.js for the backend
- MongoDB for the database
- Mailchimp API for the newsletter service
- Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) training of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for recipe generation
- The RecipeBox dataset is utilized to facilitate recipe suggestions.

These technologies are carefully integrated and optimized to ensure a high-quality user experience and accurate recipe suggestions.

## Contributors

Recipath is the result of the collaborative efforts of a talented team of developers and designers who worked tirelessly to create an innovative and engaging recipe generation website. The contributors to Recipath include:

- Ansh Midha: Lead backend developer, database designer, and AI engineer. Ansh played a pivotal role in developing the backend and designing the database schema for the application. He also applied his expertise in Artificial Intelligence to implement the recipe generation algorithm and optimize its performance.

- Vaibhav Kapoor: Lead frontend developer and UI/UX designer. Vaibhav was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend of the application using React.js. He also leveraged his skills in UI/UX design to create a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.

- Pulkit Saraf: Frontend developer. Pulkit contributed to the frontend development of the application, assisting in designing and implementing various UI components. His contributions were instrumental in creating a responsive and intuitive user interface.

Together, the team behind Recipath created a cutting-edge recipe generation website that utilizes the latest technologies and design principles to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience.

## Future Scope

Recipath is still in its early stages, and there are several areas where it can be improved and expanded. Some of the possible future directions for Recipath include:

- Integration with additional data sources: While the RecipeBox dataset provides a good starting point for generating recipes, there are many other sources of recipe data that could be integrated into the application to improve the accuracy and diversity of recipe recommendations.
- Enhanced recipe search capabilities: Currently, users can search for recipes by entering a keyword or ingredient, but there are many other ways that search functionality could be expanded. For example, users could search for recipes based on their nutritional preferences, cooking time, or complexity.
- Integration with meal planning and grocery shopping tools: Recipath could be integrated with meal planning and grocery shopping tools to provide users with a more seamless experience. For example, users could generate a shopping list based on the recipes they select or plan their meals for the week based on the recipes they generate.

## Problems

While Recipath is designed to generate recipes based on user input, there are some limitations to the accuracy and reliability of the recommendations it provides. Some of the potential issues with the application include:

- Limited dataset: The RecipeBox dataset used to train the recipe generation model is relatively small and may not include all possible ingredients or recipes. This can lead to inaccuracies in the recommendations provided by the application.
- Errors in dataset: The dataset used to train the recipe generation model may contain errors or inaccuracies, which can lead to irrelevant or misleading recipe recommendations.
- Lack of user feedback: Recipath does not currently incorporate user feedback into its recommendations. This means that if a user selects a recipe that they don't like or that doesn't turn out well, the application will not be able to adjust its recommendations based on this feedback.
- Technical issues: As with any software application, there is always the possibility of technical issues such as bugs or server downtime. While the development team is working to ensure that Recipath runs smoothly and reliably, there may be occasional issues that impact the user experience.
- Generation speed: The recipe generation process can take some time, especially when generating complex or lengthy recipes. While efforts were made to optimize the generation speed, there may be limitations due to hardware constraints and technical expertise. As the development team consists of students who are still learning, there may be further opportunities to improve the generation speed in the future.
