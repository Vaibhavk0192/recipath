# Recipath

Recipath is an AI-based recipe generation website that helps users generate recipes based on the ingredients they have and their allergies. With Recipath, users can subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated on new recipes and features.

## Tech Stack

Recipath uses the following technologies:

- React.js for the frontend
- Node.js for the backend
- MongoDB for the database
- Mailchimp API for the newsletter service

## Installation

To install Recipath on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavk0192/recipath.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Recipath`
3. Install dependencies for frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Install dependencies for backend: `cd ../backend && npm install`
5. Create an `.env` file in the root directory and set the environment variables defined in `.env.example`
6. Start the frontend server: `cd ../frontend && npm start` (The frontend will run on localhost port 3000)
7. Start the backend server: `cd ../backend && npm run dev` (The backend will run on localhost port 5000)

Note: The repository consists of two folders, `frontend` and `backend`, and several files in the root directory. You need to install all the dependencies in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders to run the application properly. Also, you need to create an `.env` file and set the environment variables defined in `.env.example` before starting the servers.
